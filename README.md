## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Bootstrap

This was a small web app created to simply take a user's order,  add it to a database, and allow it to be completed by a barista that is logged in on the server. This was my first take at using bootstrap and I'm glad with what I came out with. Styles are fresh and clean, and the learning process was fairly painless.

## Installation
